这是一个我的世界的清理插件

## Allows players to customize their home world's trash bin.

This cleaning plugin operates within a specific world (the player's home) and, when cleaning items, gathers them into a trash bin that the player has personally set up in their home. It combines various features, supports Folia, boasts highly configurable settings, and is compatible with multiple languages.

**Now, here's a hellish joke for you:**\
**Player** : Hey, my quantum solar panels got swept away by the cleaning plugin. Can you compensate me?\
**OP** : No way, you can't prove it, and my cleaning plugin doesn't keep records.\
**Player** : I just bought them!\
**OP** : What if you hid them, and I compensate you, essentially doubling them?\
**Player** : ***\
**OP** : Even if there were public trash bins on the server, someone would snatch up those solar panels.\
**OP** : What should I do?

And there you have it, this plugin was born.

When Foila supports multiple worlds, this cleaning plugin will benefit everyone

### Features:
---
- **Player-Created World Trash Bin:**\
Players have the ability to create a trash bin in their world.
Similar to the mechanics of previous sign-locked chests, the font on the sign will undergo a 
transformation after creation.
When the cleaning process is initiated, items will be automatically added to the home trash bin.
Configurable settings allow players to specify detection names and transformed names after cleaning.
